        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Sometime after the defeat of Majin Buu, peace has returned to Earth. Goku has settled down and works as a farmer to support his family. His family and friends live peaceful lives. However, a new threat appears in the form of the God of Destruction named Beerus, who is considered to be the most terrifying and the second most powerful being in Universe Seven. After awakening from decades of slumber, Beerus tells his Angel assistant and teacher named Whis that he is eager to fight the legendary warrior whom he had seen in a prophecy known as the Super Saiyan God , while threatening to destroy the Earth if he loses to him.[4] To protect Earth, Goku transforms into the Super Saiyan God to fight Beerus by using the power of five Super Saiyans, which includes Vegeta, Gohan, Goten, Trunks, and the baby named Pan in Videl's womb. Goku shows an immense amount of power that is enough to impress Beerus. Despite losing, Goku's efforts appease the God of Destruction enough that he decides to spare the planet.</p>
